```

```

## API

### [rollupPluginPosthtml](index.js#L45)
> A [posthtml] plugin for [rollup][]. The `options` are passed directly to PostHTML's `.process` method, so you can even parse a different parser and etc. You also can give `options.include` and `options.exclude` as usual for any Rollup plugin. The `options.plugins` option is passed to PostHTML directly.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: optional, passed directly to posthtml    
* `returns` **{Object}**: a Rollup plugin  

**Example**

```js
import posthtml from 'rollup-plugin-posthtml'

import sugarml from 'posthtml-sugarml'
import customElements from 'posthtml-custom-elements'

export default {
  entry: 'foo/bar/main.js',
  plugins: [
    posthtml({
      parser: sugarml(),
      plugins: customElements()
    })
  ]
}
```

### File emission

By default, processed code will be emitted as an ES module. In a such way, it will be wrapped with `export default` and provide a string when being imported. Usually it is expected behavior.
However, you may have a need to get an unwrapped result, for example, to pass it to another Rollup plugin. In this case you can simply disable `emitFile` option.
Let's have a look at the chaining PostHTML with a template compiler plugin:

```js
import dot from 'rollup-plugin-dot'
import htmlnano from 'htmlnano'

export default {
  entry: 'foo/bar/main.js',
  plugins: [
    posthtml({
      emitFile: false,
      plugins: [
         htmlnano()
      ]
    }),
    dot({
       templateSettings: {
         strip: false
       }
    })
  ]
}
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue][open-issue-url].  
Please read the [contributing guidelines][contributing-url] for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io][codementor-url] too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md][changelogmd-url] and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
